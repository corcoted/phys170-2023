# Transverse Waves
Chapter 3

## Definition of Transverse Wave
A **transverse wave** has the motion of the medium moving perpendicular to the direction that the wave itself is traveling.

The archetypal transverse wave is a vibrating string.

This is a high-speed video of a violin string.  How would you describe the motion?

## Things to try on your own...
- Put the demo in "Oscillate" mode.  Choose a frequency.  Turn on the rulers.  Pause the animation and measure the wavelength.
- What happens to the wavelength if you increase the frequency?
- Use this number and the frequency to estimate the wave speed of the string.
- What happens when you change the tension?
- What happens when you change the far end of the string (box in top right)?

## Parts of a transverse wave

<center>
![Transverse wave](figs/lecture-03/img_32.jpg){ width="80%"}
</center>
- **Wavelength** (&lambda;) is the distance (measured in meters) between repetitions of the wave.
- **Amplitude** (*a*) is the distance from the top of the wave ("crest") to the middle. (Not crest to trough.)

## Wavelength, speed, and frequency

If we measure the speed of waves (e.g. using a high-speed camera), we can see a relationship between the speed (*v*), frequency (*f*), and wavelength (&lambda;):

$$ v = f\lambda $$

This equation is true for all types of waves (sound, light, water, etc.)

::: {.fragment}
*Example:*  A vibrating guitar string has a speed of *v* = 500 m/s and a wavelength of &lambda; = 1.2 m.

What is the vibration frequency (*f*) of the string?
:::

::: {.fragment}

$$ v = f\lambda \quad\rightarrow\quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{500\,\mathrm{m/s}}{1.2\,\mathrm{m}} = 417\,\mathrm{Hz} $$

# Standing waves and resonance

## Standing wave
If we vibrate a string with certain special frequencies, the impulses travelling in each direction will overlap exactly and create a **standing wave**.

- There will be points on the wave that *do not move at all*.  These are called **nodes** (labeled by N on the drawing.)
- There are also points where the amplitude is maximal.  These are the **anti-nodes** (labeled A).
- Each pair of adjacent nodes (or anti-nodes) is separated by half of a wavelength: &lambda;/2.
:::

## Resonant wavelengths
The condition to have a standing wave depends on the details at the end of the wave.  For the case of a string clamped at both ends (like most stringed instruments), the rule is that the length of the string (*L*) must be a whole number of half-wavelengths.

$$ L = n \frac{\lambda}{2}, $$
where *n* is a whole number.  Solving for wavelength we have
$$ \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}. $$

- When *n* = 1, we call this the **fundamental** wavelength of the string.
- Higher *n* values give the **harmonics** or **partials** of the string.

Together these are called the **resonant wavelengths** (&lambda;~n~) of the string.

## Resonant frequencies
If we combine the relationships between wavelength and frequency of a wave with the resonant wavelengths (&lambda;~n~), we get

$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{2L}.
$$

These are the **resonant frequencies** of the string.  (Remember, _n_ is a whole number: 1, 2, 3, etc.)

- When *n* = 1, we call this the **fundamental** frequency of the string.
- Higher *n* values give the **harmonics** or **partials** of the string.

For example, if the fundamental frequency of a string is _f_~1~ = 440 Hz, then the first few harmonics are

- _f_~2~ = 2 _f_~1~ = 880 Hz,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_f_~3~ = 3 _f_~1~ = 1320 Hz,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_f_~4~ = 4 _f_~1~ = 1760 Hz, etc.

## Activity: Wave machine

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
We're going to build a simple "Shive wave machine" like shown in the book using some popsicle sticks and tape.

- Put 3 or 4 desks together to make a table
- Pull off a long piece of tape that stretches across the desks, sticky side up
- Put popsicle sticks evenly placed crosswise along the length of the tape, about a finger-width apart
- Once it's made, pick it up and suspend it between a pair of desks
- Push down on one of the sticks at the end.  What happens to the other sticks?
- Estimate the speed of the waves?
- Can you vibrate one end and create standing waves?
