## Announcements

* Homework 1 will be posted soon.  It will be due Friday, Jan. 20, uploaded to Canvas.

## Daily quiz

- In your own words, write a brief definition of "sound".

## Outline

- Sound and music
- Vibrations
- Simple harmonic motion
  - Frequency
  - Period

# Sound and Music

## Sound
We're going to define sound from a scientific perspective as "mechanical vibrations transmitted through an elastic medium."

::: {.smaller}
::: {.incremental}
- "mechanical" meaning that *objects* are moving (gas molecules or wood molecules or etc.)
- "vibrations" we'll define later
- "transmitted" meaning that something is travelling from one place to another
- the "medium" is the substance the sound travels through
- "elastic" means that the changes to the medium are temporary

## Propagation of Sound

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
For music, sound mostly propagates through the air.

::: {.fragment}
There are regions of compressed air that travel from the source to the listener.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Looking more closely, we see something like

## Periodic motion

::: {.fragment}
"Periodic" means repeating exactly over time.
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
The motion can be simple...

... or complex

::: {.fragment}
as long as it repeats.  Musical sound is mostly periodic.
:::

::: {.fragment}
The time between repetitions is the **period**, usually represented by *T* and measured in seconds.
:::

------------------

### Aside: unit prefixes {.smaller}
We'll see the following prefixes when discussing measured values:

- "micro-" means one-millionth, abbreviated by "&mu;" (Greek letter mu)
  - For example, the periods of sound waves are often hundreds of microseconds (&mu;s)
- "milli-" means one-thousandth, abbreviated by "m"
- "kilo-" means one thousand, abbreviated by "k"
  - The frequency of sound waves is often a few kilohertz (kHz)


See Appendx A.1.1 of the textbook for more examples.

-------------------------

### On your own...

- Play with the demo and vary the mass or spring constant
- What effect do changing these have on the motion?

## Simple harmonic motion

The simplest type of periodic motion is called "simple harmonic motion".

Physics has a lot of examples, some shown here:

Pendulum, Spring, Reed, Tuning Fork

:::

::: {.fragment}
To a good approximation, these all obey the same math.
:::

## Definitions

::: {.incremental}
- **Period** is the time between repetitions (*T*), measured in seconds (s)
- **Wavelength** is the distance between repetitions (*&lambda;*, Greek letter lambda), measured in meters (m)
- **Frequency** is the number of waves per second (*f*), measured in "cycles per second" or Hertz (Hz)
- **Phase** is how far along the repeating cycle is at one instant of time.  We'll come back to this later.

----------------------------

### On your own...

- Play with the demo and vary the frequency and amplitude.
- Notice how the wavelength and period change
  - You can measure these by dragging around the meter tool or the using the stopwatch

## Frequency and period

Frequency (*f*) and period (*T*) have a simple relationship:

$$ f = \frac{1}{T} \qquad\mathrm{or}\qquad T = \frac{1}{f}. $$

Usually in music and acoustics we're more interested in the frequency.

## Example problem

The concert A used as the tuning note for most modern orchestras has a frequency of *f* = 440 Hz.  What is the period of this sound?

::: {.fragment text-color="red"}
The equation we need is

$$ T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{440\,\mathrm{Hz}} = 0.0023\,\mathrm{s} = 2.3\,\mathrm{ms}. $$
:::

::: {.fragment}
The period of a concert A is 2.3 milliseconds.
