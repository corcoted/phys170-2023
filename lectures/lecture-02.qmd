# Sound and Music

## Sound
We're going to define sound from a scientific perspective as "mechanical vibrations transmitted through an elastic medium."

- "mechanical" meaning that *objects* are moving (gas molecules or wood molecules or etc.)
- "vibrations" we'll define later
- "transmitted" meaning that something is travelling from one place to another
- the "medium" is the substance the sound travels through
- "elastic" means that the changes to the medium are temporary
