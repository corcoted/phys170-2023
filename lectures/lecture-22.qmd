# Review: Analog sound transmission and reproduction

## Fidelity

*Fidelity* is a measure of how accurately the output sound matches the input sound.
This is an objective measurement: we can define it using math.

Often the word "fidelity" is used colloquially to mean "subjectively sounds good."
Much of the debate about the quality of recordings or amplifiers is really about personal preference, not mathematical accuracy.

Key aspects of fidelity are

- minimal noise
- flat frequency response
- minimal distortion

## Analog sound chain

The sequence of events from the production of a sound to its reception by the listener is the *sound chain*.

Each step of the chain and each transition can reduce fidelity.  Importantly, analog noise sources are *random* and *unpredictable*, and analog storage media *degrade over time*.

## Gain and attenuation

Gain is the overall increase in sound power (*P*) caused by an element in the sound chain.

These are usually specified in [decibels](lecture-08.html#decibels):

$$
\text{Gain} = (10\,\mathrm{dB}) \log \left(\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \right),
$$

- A positive gain means that power increases (e.g. by an amplifier).
- A negative gain (also called *attenuation*) means that power decreases.

## Frequency filters

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Audio elements that intentionally have a nonlinear frequency response are called filters.

Here are some common terms:

- *High pass* - passes high frequencies and blocks low frequencies
- *Low pass* - passes low frequencies and blocks high frequencies
- *Band pass* - blocks frequencies outside of a certain range
- *Band block* - blocks frequencies inside of a certain range
- *Notch filter* - blocks a very narrow frequency range (e.g. to block 60 Hz pick-up)
- *Line filter* - passes a very narrow frequency range (e.g. to remove noise on a power line)
- *DC block* - blocks extremely low frequencies

## Noise

Every audio element and every transition generates noise.  *Noise* is undesired, often random, electrical energy that corrupts the signal.

Environmental noise:

- Outside sound sources: Crowd noise, HVAC, traffic, etc.
- Outside electrical sources: 60Hz AC power buzz, RF pickup, microphonics (unwanted sound creating electrical signals)

Technical noise:

- [Thermal (Johnson-Nyquist) noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise) - any electrical component that generates heat, also generates electrical noise. ([Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation-dissipation_theorem))
- [Shot noise or popcorn noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise) - small currents come in chunks as each electron goes through the circuit.
- [Flicker noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_noise) - electrons bouncing across semiconductor junctions

Technical noise can be minimized with good electronic design, but not eliminated
