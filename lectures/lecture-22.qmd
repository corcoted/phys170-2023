# Review: Analog sound transmission and reproduction

## Fidelity

*Fidelity* is a measure of how accurately the output sound matches the input sound.
This is an objective measurement: we can define it using math.

Often the word "fidelity" is used colloquially to mean "subjectively sounds good."
Much of the debate about the quality of recordings or amplifiers is really about personal preference, not mathematical accuracy.

Key aspects of fidelity are

- minimal noise
- flat frequency response
- minimal distortion

## Analog sound chain

The sequence of events from the production of a sound to its reception by the listener is the *sound chain*.

![](figs/lecture-22/SoundChain-AnalogPlus.svg.svg){ style="scale:0.6;" }

Each step of the chain and each transition can reduce fidelity.  Importantly, analog noise sources are *random* and *unpredictable*, and analog storage media *degrade over time*.

## Waveforms

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The *waveform* of a sound is a plot of pressure changes over time.  I'll represent it mathematically as $y(t)$.

In practice we use a microphone to convert the pressure into an electric signal (current or voltage), and that is what we display.

## Frequency Power Spectrum

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

The waveform tells us about the sound signal at any instant in time, but here we need to understand the broad characteristics of a sound and how they are affected by the transmission and reproduction process.

The most common mathematical tool is the Frequency Power Spectrum, which is defined as

$$
P(f) = \left| \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty y(t) e^{2\pi i ft} \,dt\right|^2
$$

This is the magnitude-squared of the Fourier Transform of the waveform.

In practice the power spectrum is estimated using digital techniques, which we'll talk about in the next lecture.

## Gain and attenuation

Gain is the overall increase in sound power (*P*) caused by an element in the sound chain.

These are usually specified in [decibels](lecture-08.html#decibels):

$$
\text{Gain} = (10\,\mathrm{dB}) \log \left(\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \right),
$$

- A positive gain means that power increases (e.g. by an amplifier).
- A negative gain (also called *attenuation*) means that power decreases.

## Frequency response

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Each element of the sound chain has a particular *frequency response* in addition to any overall gain or attenuation.

The frequency response is defined as the gain at each frequency (rather than overall gain).

To get high fidelity, we want a *flat* frequency response.

The graph here shows several possible frequency response curves.  A non-flat response on an element might be desirable either to compensate for the frequency response of another element.  An overall non-flat response might be desirable to block noise or simply for the listener's preference.

## Frequency filters

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Audio elements that intentionally have a nonlinear frequency response are called filters.

Here are some common terms:

- *High pass* - passes high frequencies and blocks low frequencies
- *Low pass* - passes low frequencies and blocks high frequencies
- *Band pass* - blocks frequencies outside of a certain range
- *Band block* - blocks frequencies inside of a certain range
- *Notch filter* - blocks a very narrow frequency range (e.g. to block 60 Hz pick-up)
- *Line filter* - passes a very narrow frequency range (e.g. to remove noise on a power line)
- *DC block* - blocks extremely low frequencies

## Noise

Every audio element and every transition generates noise.  *Noise* is undesired, often random, electrical energy that corrupts the signal.

Environmental noise:

- Outside sound sources: Crowd noise, HVAC, traffic, etc.
- Outside electrical sources: 60Hz AC power buzz, RF pickup, microphonics (unwanted sound creating electrical signals)

Technical noise:

- [Thermal (Johnson-Nyquist) noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise) - any electrical component that generates heat, also generates electrical noise. ([Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation-dissipation_theorem))
- [Shot noise or popcorn noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise) - small currents come in chunks as each electron goes through the circuit.
- [Flicker noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_noise) - electrons bouncing across semiconductor junctions

Technical noise can be minimized with good electronic design, but not eliminated

## Noise colors

Informal names for the frequency spectra of noise are based on color.

See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise>

- Johnson noise is white
- Flicker noise is pink

## Signal to noise ratio

The signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the ratio between power of the average signal and power of the strongest noise source.
It is often specified in decibels.

$$
\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{dB} = (10\,\mathrm{dB}) \log\left(\frac{P_{signal}}{P_{noise}} \right)
$$

The rule-of-thumb for Hi-Fi is a SNR of at least 60 dB.

## Distortion

Distortion is any effect that changes the frequencies of pure tones.

- *Harmonic distortion* adds new signals at multiples of the input frequencies
- *Intermodulation distortion* adds new signals at the combination tones of the input frequencies

Distortion always causes a loss of fidelity.

## Amplifiers

*Amplifiers* are devices that increase the sound power.  Some amplifiers (esp. pre-amps) are used to match the electrical impedance between two devices (e.g. a microphone and a transmission line).

A perfect amplifier would have

- the same amount of gain at every frequency
- no maximum power output (no saturation)
- no distortion
- no noise

## Comparing amps

Most of the debate about amplifiers is about which flaws give subjectively better sound.  E.g. tube amps are often described as "warm" and "lively" because they have soft saturation, predominantly white noise spectra, and low harmonic distortion.

Much of the bad-reputation for solid-state (e.g. transistor) amps is based on the initial impressions when transistors were first invented.  Modern semiconductor technology creates objectively higher fidelity than tube amps, but many people still prefer the sound of tube amps.
