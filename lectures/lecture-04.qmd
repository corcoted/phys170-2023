## Structure of longitudinal waves
In **longitudinal waves** the particles move in the same direction as the wave itself.

## Comparison of transverse and longitudinal waves
Most of our ideas from last time carry over to longitudinal waves

- **wavelength**, **period**, **frequency**, and **speed** are all defined the same way
- **standing waves**, **resonances**, and **harmonics** also happen (although the math depends on the details at the ends)

## Most longitudinal waves are pressure waves
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
Sound waves in air are fluctuations in pressure.

These pressure fluctuations are tiny (a billionth to a thousandth of atmospheric pressure)!

We typically don't measure the pressure directly, although speakers and microphones work on this principle.

*In space no one can hear you scream.*
:::

::: {.fragment}
Is this a true statement?  Why?
:::

::: {.fragment}
Yes, because sound needs matter to travel throught.

Space has no air, so sound can't travel.
:::

## Medium of transmission
Sound waves must travel through some kind of matter, which we call the *medium* of transmission.

For music, the medium is usually air, but sound also travels through

- the solid body of musical instruments
- the floors and walls
- the structures of the human body (e.g. the parts of the ear)

Today we want to define a couple of terms describing how sound moves through matter: *speed* and *impedance*.

## Speed of sound
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
The speed of sound in an object depends on many factors

::: {.incremental}
- the material
- the environment (temperature, ambient pressure, humidity)
- the shape of the object
- the frequency of the sound ("dispersion")
:::

::: {.fragment}
The table on the right assumes a bulk material (much bigger than the wavelength of the sound) and a sound frequency of 1000 Hz.
:::

::: aside
Note that the book often uses the approximation of 350 m/s for the speed of sound in air.

## Waves carry information
We think of the speed of sound as telling us how quickly *energy* moves through a medium, but it also tells us how fast *information* travels.

We can demonstrate this will a high-speed camera...

## Impedance {.incremental}
A second property of the medium or object that sound travels through is *impedance*.

**Impedance** (symbol: *z*, units: Pa m/s = Rayls) is a measure of how difficult it is for sound to move through a medium or object.

For bulk media (as opposed to a specific object), the impedance is related to the speed of sound and the density of the medium:

$$ z = \rho v, $$

- *z* is the impedance (units of Pa s/m, also called "Rayls")
- &rho; is the mass density of the medium (units of kg/m^3^)
- *v* is the speed of sound in the medium (units of m/s)

## Example: impedance of air

For example, air at room temperature (20°C) has a speed of *v*&nbsp;=&nbsp;343&nbsp;m/s and a density of &rho;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.20&nbsp;kg/m^3^.  Therefore, the impedance of air at room temperature is *z*&nbsp;=&nbsp;&rho;*v*&nbsp;=&nbsp;413&nbsp;Pa&nbsp;m/s.

## Sound at boundaries
:::: { .columns }
::: {.column width="60%"}
When a sound wave strikes a boundary between different materials, the energy divides three ways:

- some is transmitted through the boundary
- some is reflected by the boundary
- some may be absorbed, depending on the material

Impedance is the property that tells us about transmission and reflection.

## Impedance matching

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
For sound to go efficiently from one object/medium to another, their impedances must be equal.

- The bones of the human inner ear match the impedance of air to the impedance of the fluid inside the cochlea.
- A car muffler works by intentionally *mismatching* the impedance of the exhaust pipe and the outside air.
- In general, if sound is moving from impedance *z*~1~ to impedance *z*~2~, the fraction of transmitted sound energy will be
$$ T = 1-\left(\frac{z_1-z_2}{z_1+z_2} \right)^2 $$

## Musical instruments

:::: { .columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
One of the main functions of a musical instrument is to match the impedance of the sound source (e.g. violin string, oboe reed, human vocal folds) to the outside air.

Consider the difference between an acoustic guitar and an electric guitar.  Which one is impedance matched to the air?

A trumpet mute also works by changing the impedance of the trumpet, not by absorbing the sound.
