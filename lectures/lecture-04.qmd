## Announcements
- The first homework is due next Tuesday.  

## Daily quiz
- Draw two pictures:  One of a transverse wave and one of a longitudinal wave.

# Longitudinal Waves

## Structure of longitudinal waves
In **longitudinal waves** the particles move in the same direction as the wave itself.

Here the loops of the spring are compressed together.

Here the beads are pushed together.

## Comparison of transverse and longitudinal waves
Most of our ideas from last time carry over to longitudinal waves

- **wavelength**, **period**, **frequency**, and **speed** are all defined the same way
- **standing waves**, **resonances**, and **harmonics** also happen (although the math depends on the details at the ends)

# Sound transmission

## Waves carry information
We think of the speed of sound as telling us how quickly energy moves through a medium, but it also tells us how fast *information* travels.
