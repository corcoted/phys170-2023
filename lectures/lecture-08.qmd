# Exam discussion

# Hearing

## Human ear

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   *Outer ear* - collects the sound as a propagates through the air
    -   *Pinna* - the part of the ear on the outside (sound bucket) the funnels sound into the ear canal
    -   *Ear canal* - impedance matches between the outside air and the ear drum
-   *Middle ear* - a set of 3 small bones act as levers to match the impedance between the ear drum and the oval window on the cochlea.
-   *Inner ear* - converts sound waves into nerve impulses (see next page)

## Inner ear

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The *cochlea* is the sound processing organ in the ear.

-   shaped like a long spiral containing a pair of fluid-filled tubes
-   between the tubes is the *basilar membrane* that sorts the sound waves by frequency
-   on the basilar membrane is the *Organ of Corti* that contains hair cells
-   the *hair cells* vibrate as the sound waves pass, stimulating the nerve cells to send signals to the brain

Long wavelength (low frequency) sound waves penetrate deeper into the cochlea than short wavelength (high frequency) waves. This is how the ear distiguishes pitch.

# Sound Intensity

## Definitions of Intensity and Loudness

- **Intensity** is a measure of how much sound energy passes through a surface in a certain amount of time (power per area).
  - This is an *objective* description of sound that we can measure with a machine (e.g. with a sound meter).
- **Loudness** (or "volume") is the *human perception* of sound intensity.
  - It is a *subjective* description of sound as heard by each listener.
  - Dynamics markings in a musical score (forte, piano, etc.) indicate loudness.
  - Because each listener may hear something different (e.g. because of age or medical condition), loudness is harder to describe precisely.
  - We'll come back to loudness in the next chapter to talk about how an *average* adult human perceives intensity and the different factors that affect loudness.

## Energy, Power, and Intensity

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- **Energy (*E*)** is the capacity to do work. It is measured as *joules* (J), which the book also calls newton-meters (N m).
- **Power (*P*)** is the rate at which energy is emitted or absorbed. Power is measured in *watts* (W), which is also joules per seconds.
- **Intensity (*I*)** is the amount of power divided by the area it passes through, measured in *watts per square-meter* (W/m^2^).

$$P = IA$$

The power is represented by total number of arrows through each green area.

The intensity is the power divided by the area in each case.

## Example problem on intensity
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
A studio monitor outputs 2 W of sound power.
The diameter of the speaker is 20 cm (about 8 inches).
What is the sound intensity just next to the front of the speaker?

(Reminder: area of a circle is $A=\pi d^2/4$ .)

## We sense ratios, not differences

The sound intensities that humans can here vary from about 10^-12^&nbsp;W/m^2^ to 1&nbsp;W/m^2^, a factor of a trillion apart.
The way our brain deals with great spreads like this is to measure ratios (fractions) rather than differences.
(Also, this happens because of the way nerves activate.)

For example, we can sense when intensity doubles, but we can't hear a whisper added to a jet engine.

Our brain divides and multiplies; it does not add or subtract.

Many of our senses use this type of compression:

- Sound intensity, sound frequency (musical pitch)
- Light intensity (but *not* color)
- Touch (pressure)
- Heat flow

## Decibels
To avoid writing very small and very large numbers (lots of zeros or decimals points) to represent quantities with a lot of dynamics range, engineers often use a logarithmic scale called *decibels* (dB) to express ratios.

The mathematical definition of decibels is

$$\text{decibels} = 10 \log\left(\frac{\text{measurement value}}{\text{reference value}}\right),$$

where "log" is the common (base-10) logarithm function found on a calculator.

If we're given the decibel level and we need the measurement value, we solve the equation above to get

$$\text{measurement} = \text{reference value} \times 10^{\text{decibels}/10} $$

## Sound intensity levels (S~IL~)

The reference value for a decibel conversion is usually something agreed upon by the community.
For example, when measuring sound intensity, the reference value is taken as the threshold of hearing for a typical adult human: *I*~0~ = 10^-12^ W/m^2^, giving us the following definition for Sound Intensity Level (*S*~IL~), measured in decibels:

$$S_{IL} = 10 \log(I/I_0)$$

or, flipping this around to solve for intensity:

$$I = I_0 \times 10^{S_{IL}/10},$$

where for sound, *I*~0~ = 10^-12^ W/m^2^ by definition.

## Rules of thumb for decibels
If you don't have a calculator handy...

- 0 dB means *the same*
- +3 dB is about twice as big
- +5 dB is about three times as big
- +10 dB means ten times bigger
- +20 dB means 100 times bigger
- The pattern +#0 dB is 1 with # zeros times bigger.
- negative dBs means that factor smaller: -10 dB = ten times smaller.
- adding two dB values is the same as multiplying their intensities.
  -  Example: +13 dB = 10 dB + 3 dB = 10 &times; 2 = 20 times bigger. 
- subtracting two dB values is the same as dividing their intensities.


## Example problems: decibels
-  A typical speaking voice at a comfortable distance has an intensity level of 70&nbsp;dB.
   -  What is the intensity value (in W/m^2^)?
   -  If two people talk at the same time, what is the combined intensity? combined *S*~IL~?

## Limits of human hearing

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
We'll discuss the idea of loudness in detail next time, but one simple difference is that our experience of loudness depends on the frequency of the sound.
Human ears work best around 1000 Hz.  Our ears are less sensitive at higher and lower frequencies.

The red curve shows the minimum sound intensity that we can detect as a function of frequency.
The blue curves are loudness values relative to the threshold.

## Dynamic Range

An important concept related to this that doesn't show up in the textbook until the chapters on recording is dynamic range.

**Dynamic Range** is the ratio between the largest possible measurement and the smallest possible measurement.

So, the dynamic range of *intensity* for human hearing is about 10^12^ or 120 dB.  By comparison, a 16-bit ADC on a digital recording deck has a dynamic range of 2^16^ &approx; 65,000 or 48 dB.

The dynamic range of *frequency* for human hearing is about 20,000 Hz/20 Hz = 1,000 or 30 dB.

## Line levels

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Audio recording equipment usually specifies intensity relative to the line level.
**Line level** is the *maximum* signal that can pass through an electronic audio system without saturating (analog) or clipping (digital) the signal.

In this case the reference level is always higher than the sound level.
When we convert this to decibels, we get a negative number.
Roughly, the numbers come out to

-  0 dB = Maximum signal without distortion
-  -10 dB = an typical signal value
-  -45 dB = the lowest signal detectable

We'll come back to the details later in the semester.

## Intensity and distance

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Intensity decreases as you move away from a source. If you were in completely empty space (no walls, floors, or ceiling), sound waves would come out in the shape of spheres.

Imagine blowing up a baloon with a sound source in the center of the baloon. The same amount of sound power (*P*) passes through the surface of the baloon regardless of how big it is, but the intensity will go down as the radius (*r*) of the baloon gets bigger.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![The relationship between sound intensity and distance is called the *inverse square law*. Many laws of physics have this pattern: gravity, electricity, and light intensity, for example.](figs/lecture-08/Inverse_square_law.svg)
:::
:::

$$P = IA = I (4\pi r^2)\quad\rightarrow\quad I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$

## Example: Intensity
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
The [Sumbergh Head foghorn](https://www.sumburghhead.com/foghorn) in Shetland, UK, emits a tone of 120 Hz that can be heard 30 kilometers away.  If the threshold of hearing at this frequency is *S*~IL~ = 30 dB, what is the power of the foghorn?  (Assume the sound waves come out as perfect spheres.)
