## Announcements

- Homework 3 is due tonight.
  - Please submit only *one* PDF file for your whole assignment.

## Daily Quiz

List two or more ways of changing the speed of waves on a string.

## Group project

<!-- TODO points, etc. -->
- Groups of 3 or 4.
  - Send me an email today with a list of people you want to work with.
  - I will assign the groups, using your suggestions as best as I can.

- **Goal:** Your group will *build a musical instrument*
  - Must be able to play a simple melody
  - Must explain how it produces sound and how you control it
  - Characterization of the sound will be part of the final report
  - Written and oral presentations due at the end of the semester

## Project steps

Details will follow in the coming weeks, but here is the tentative plan with tentative deadlines.

1. Present a plan (2/21)
2. Build a prototype 
3. Characterize the prototype and write a progress report (3/21)
4. Refine the prototype
5. Write a final report (4/20)
6. Present your instrument and results to the class (4/28, Final Exam Day)

# Review: Transverse Waves
Topics from [Lecture 3](lecture-03.html).

## Parts of a transverse wave

<center>
![Transverse wave](figs/lecture-03/img_32.jpg){ width="80%"}
</center>
- **Wavelength** (&lambda;) is the distance (measured in meters) between repetitions of the wave.
- **Amplitude** (*a*) is the distance from the top of the wave ("crest") to the middle. (Not crest to trough.)

## Wavelength, speed, and frequency

If we measure the speed of waves (e.g. using a high-speed camera), we can see a relationship between the speed (*v*), frequency (*f*), and wavelength (&lambda;):

$$ v = f\lambda $$

This equation is true for all types of waves (sound, light, water, etc.)

## Standing wave
If we vibrate a string with certain special frequencies, the impulses travelling in each direction will overlap exactly and create a **standing wave**.

- There will be points on the wave that *do not move at all*.  These are called **nodes** (labeled by N on the drawing.)
- There are also points where the amplitude is maximal.  These are the **anti-nodes** (labeled A).
- Each pair of adjacent nodes (or anti-nodes) is separated by half of a wavelength: &lambda;/2.

## Resonant wavelengths
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
For a string clamped at both ends (like most stringed instruments), the rule is that the length of the string (*L*) must be a whole number of half-wavelengths ("loops").

$$ L = n \frac{\lambda}{2}, $$
where *n* is a whole number.  Solving for wavelength we have
$$ \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}. $$

Together these are called the **resonant wavelengths** (&lambda;~n~) of the string.

## Resonant frequencies
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
If we combine the relationships between wavelength and frequency of a wave with the resonant wavelengths (&lambda;~n~), we get

$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{2L} = nf_1.
$$

These are the **resonant frequencies** of the string.  (Remember, _n_ is a whole number: 1, 2, 3, etc.)

Notice that the fundamental frequency $f_1=v/(2L)$ depends on two things:

- the length of the string *L*
- the speed on the string *v*.

We'll come back to this.

## Normal modes demo
![<https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/normal-modes>](figs/lecture-10/phet-normal-modes.png){width=80%}

# String motion

## Perfectly plucked string
Which modes are excited when you bow, pluck, or hammer a string depend on where and how you move the string.

Each mode *f~n~* will have its own amplitude, just like in the simulation.

In the approximation that you pluck a string a small amount at a precise position *x* on the string (measured in meters), the amplitude of the *n*^th^ mode, *a~n~* is given by

$$
a_n = \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L} \right),
$$
where the sine function is evaluated in radians mode.

## Choosing the harmonics

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Because of the earlier equation, if you pluck a string at the antinodes and stop it at the nodes of a particular mode, you can select which harmonics get activated.

The mode drawing gives you a map about where to do this.

For example, if you stop a string exactly in the center and pluck it 1/4 of the way from the end, then gently release the stop, you'll excite the 2nd harmonic (which is the octave).

Try this with a real instrument and see if you can do it.

(Bonus: on a fretted instrument, which frets line up with the nodes of certain modes?)

# Wave speed on a string

## Changing the speed
The two ways we can adjust the fundamental mode of a string are by changing the length of the string or the speed of waves on the string.

The speed depends on two factors:

- How much tension force *F* is on the string
- How "heavy" the string is, where "heavy" is the mass density of the string *m* (e.g. kilograms per meter)

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{F}{m}}
$$

## Mersenne's Rules
Combining the speed equation with the mode equation gives Mersenne's Rules

The fundamental frequency of a string is

1. Inverse to its length (*L*)
2. Proportional to the square root of the tension (*F*)
3. Inverse to its diameter (thickness)
4. Inverse to the square-root of its density

These are summarized by the equation

$$
f_1 = \frac{v}{2L} = \frac{1}{2L}\,\sqrt{\frac{F}{m}},
$$
where rule 3 and 4 are combined as the mass per length *m*.

## Example
A guitar string has length *L*=62.8 cm.  One string has a mass per length of *m*=5.3 g/m and a tension of *F*=230 N.  What is its frequency?
