## Psychoacoustics

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}
::: { style="font-size:85%" }
[*Psychoacoustics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics) is the scientific study of how humans perceive sound.

Once sound enters our ears at least two steps happen that can affect what we hear

- The sound gets transmitted from the air to the cochlea, and then converted to nerve impulses
- Those nerve impulses are interpreted by our brain

The first one we can do objective experiments to understand.

The second requires asking test subjects to tell us what they hear, so is necessarily a subjective experiment.

Modern technology like [Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) is moving the boundary between the objective and subjective by allowing us to see into the brain itself.

## Application: Cochlear Implants

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Psychoacoustic experiments were key in the development of [cochlear implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant) to aid individuals with hearing loss.

The CI uses a microphone to detect sound and then processes the sound and turns it into electrical impulses that are sent directly to the user's cochlear nerve, bypassing most of the ear.

# Perceived tones

## Effects with clear physics explanations

Some of the effects in this chapter than we can possibly attribute to physics are the *combination tones* and *periodicity tones*.

- *Combination tones* are perceived tones at the sums and differences of two or more frequencies.
- *Periodicity tones* are perceived tones that are simple ratios of frequencies.

There are plausible mechanisms for combining two or more pure tones 

## Beat notes are combination tones

Combination tones occur at sums or differences of two pure tones.

[*Beat notes*](/lectures/lecture-05.html#/beat-notes) are an example of this.  If I have two pure tones *f*~1~ and *f*~2~ of almost the same frequency, we hear a beat note at their difference:

$$
f_\text{beat} = |f_1 - f_2|
$$

If we increase the frequency separation, eventually this becomes an additionally perceived pure tone.

We heard this in the [chirp demo](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C2/C2S3_InterferenceBeating.html#Chirp-Experiment) from Lecture 5.

## Nonlinear effects

Combination tones can be generated from pure tones if there are *nonlinear effects* in the ear.

A *linear system* is allowed to do only two things to a waveform:

- Multiply the waveform amplitude by a number (amplification, gain)
- Add or subtract two waveforms (superposition)

If we only do these things, the frequencies that come out will be the same as the ones we put in: nothing is added or taken away.

Any thing else we do to a waveform is nonlinear: squaring, exponentiation, log, clipping, multiplying waveforms together, etc.
In these cases the frequencies will change, which we call *harmonic distortion*.

## Example: squaring a waveform {.smaller}

Take two waveforms with different frequencies *f*~1~ and *f*~2~:

$$
y_1 (t) = A_1 \sin (2\pi f_1 t);\qquad
y_2 (t) = A_2 \sin (2\pi f_2 t).
$$

Add them together (a linear operation), then square the waveform.  After some algebra we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(y_1(t)+y_2(t)\right)^2 &= \left(A_1 \sin (2\pi f_1 t) + A_2 \sin (2\pi f_2 t) \right)^2\\
&= A_1^2 \sin^2(2\pi f_1 t) + A_2^2 \sin^2(2\pi f_2 t) + 2 A_1 A_2 \sin(2\pi f_1 t)\sin(2\pi f_2 t)\\
&= \frac12 A_1^2 -\frac12 A_1^2 \cos(4\pi f_1 t)+\frac12 A_2^2 -\frac12 A_2^2 \cos(4\pi f_2 t)\\
&\quad + \frac12 A_1A_2 \cos\left(2\pi (f_1-f_2)t\right)-\frac12 A_1A_2 \cos\left(2\pi (f_1+f_2)t\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The math details aren't important.  The important thing is that the list of frequencies has changed:

$$
f_1,\, f_2 \quad \rightarrow 2f_1,\, 2f_2,\, (f_1-f_2),\, (f_1+f_2).
$$

The point is **any nonlinearity will cause new frequencies to appear**.
In electronic recording gear, we call this effect *distortion*.  In the human ear, this is the cause of *combination tones*. 

## Combination tones
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Regardless of the physiological reason, humans perceive combination tones when two or more pure tones are played together, particularly if those tones are loud.

The new frequencies follow a pattern:
$$
f_\text{combo} = nf_1 + mf_2,
$$
where *n* and *m* are integers (positive or negative).

The bigger *n* and *m* are, the weaker the perceived tone is.

## Periodicity tones

*Periodicity tones* are perceived subharmonics at the common denominator for simple frequency ratios.

::: {.fragment}
For example, when playing a perfect fifth (3:2) or perfect fourth (4:3) and sometimes a major third (5:4), one can hear the *missing fundamental* of that harmonic series.  At higher intervals this effect diminishes.
:::

::: {.fragment}
In the [Beat-notes demo](https://academo.org/demos/wave-interference-beat-frequency/) from [Lecture 5](/lectures/lecture-05.html), try these frequency combinations:

- Perfect 5th: 200\ Hz and 300\ Hz
- Perfect 4th: 300\ Hz and 400\ Hz
- Major 3rd: 400\ Hz and 500\ Hz

Do you hear the 100\ Hz fundamental in each case?

## The missing fundamental and pipe organs

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Builders of pipe organs going back at least to the Renaissance knew about the missing fundamental effect, called *mutations* in this context.

A "Bourdon" (French for bumblebee) or "Untersatz" (German, literally "sits under") organ stop on many organs actually plays 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the desired bass note to avoid the need for really tall pipes.  (It is also a half-closed pipe, dropping the pitch by an additional octave.)

## Rhythm analogy

The perception of a periodicity tone may work similarly to how we perceive the beats in complex rhythms.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
Consider these two rhythms superimposed:

Where is the beat?  Our brain tells us it is where the *combined* pattern of doublets and triplets repeat.
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
This is analogous to the waveform for a perfect fifth (frequency ratio 3:2)

# Difference tone or periodicity tone?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

In an earlier slide, I played these examples of periodicity tones 
using the [Beat-notes demo](https://academo.org/demos/wave-interference-beat-frequency/).

- Perfect 5th: 200\ Hz and 300\ Hz
- Perfect 4th: 300\ Hz and 400\ Hz
- Major 3rd: 400\ Hz and 500\ Hz

::: {.fragment}
We heard the 100\ Hz fundamental in each case, which we attributed to the periodicity tone.
:::

::: {.fragment}
But wait a minute... *These also have difference tones at 100\ Hz!*  Which is it?  Can we do an experiment?
