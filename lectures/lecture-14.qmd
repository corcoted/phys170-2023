## Psychoacoustics

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="75%"}
::: { style="font-size:85%" }
[*Psychoacoustics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics) is the scientific study of how humans perceive sound.

Once sound enters our ears at least two steps happen that can affect what we hear

- The sound gets transmitted from the air to the cochlea, and then converted to nerve impulses
- Those nerve impulses are interpreted by our brain

The first one we can do objective experiments to understand.

The second requires asking test subjects to tell us what they hear, so is necessarily a subjective experiment.

Modern technology like [Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging) is moving the boundary between the objective and subjective by allowing us to see into the brain itself.

## Application: Cochlear Implants

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Psychoacoustic experiments were key in the development of [cochlear implants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant) to aid individuals with hearing loss.

The CI uses a microphone to detect sound and then processes the sound and turns it into electrical impulses that are sent directly to the user's cochlear nerve, bypassing most of the ear.
