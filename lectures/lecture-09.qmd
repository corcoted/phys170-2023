## Definitions of Intensity and Loudness

- **Intensity** is a measure of how much sound energy passes through a surface in a certain amount of time (power per area).
  - This is an *objective* description of sound that we can measure with a machine (e.g. with a sound meter).
- **Loudness** (or "volume") is the *human perception* of sound intensity.
  - It is a *subjective* description of sound as heard by each listener.
  - Dynamics markings in a musical score (forte, piano, etc.) indicate loudness.
  - Because each listener may hear something different (e.g. because of age or medical condition), loudness is harder to describe precisely.
  - We'll come back to loudness in the next chapter to talk about how an *average* adult human perceives intensity and the different factors that affect loudness.

## Energy, Power, and Intensity

- **Energy (*E*)** is the capacity to do work. It is measured as *joules* (J), which the book also calls newton-meters (N m).
- **Power (*P*)** is the rate at which energy is emitted or absorbed. Power is measured in *watts* (W), which is also joules per seconds.
- **Intensity (*I*)** is the amount of power divided by the area it passes through, measured in *watts per square-meter* (W/m^2^).

## Decibels
To avoid writing very small and very large numbers (lots of zeros or decimals points) to represent quantities with a lot of dynamics range, engineers often use a logarithmic scale called *decibels* (dB) to express ratios.

The mathematical definition of decibels is

$$\text{decibels} = 10 \log\left(\frac{\text{measurement value}}{\text{reference value}}\right),$$

where "log" is the common (base-10) logarithm function found on a calculator.

If we're given the decibel level and we need the measurement value, we solve the equation above to get

$$\text{measurement} = \text{reference value} \times 10^{\text{decibels}/10} $$

## Sound intensity levels (S~IL~)

The reference value for a decibel conversion is usually something agreed upon by the community.
For example, when measuring sound intensity, the reference value is taken as the threshold of hearing for a typical adult human: *I*~0~ = 10^-12^ W/m^2^, giving us the following definition for Sound Intensity Level (*S*~IL~), measured in decibels:

$$S_{IL} = 10 \log(I/I_0)$$

or, flipping this around to solve for intensity:

$$I = I_0 \times 10^{S_{IL}/10},$$

where for sound, *I*~0~ = 10^-12^ W/m^2^ by definition.

# Intensity, pressure, and impedance
Lions and Tigers and Bears! Oh my!

## Pressure
One detail the book leaves out in Chapter 9 is the link between changes in air pressure and the sound intensity.
We need this information to link to the various measures of loudness in this chapter.

**Pressure** is the force per unit area applied to a surface.  It has units of newtons per square-meter, also called "pascals" (Pa).
Standard atmospheric air pressure is 101325 Pa.  Sound waves in air are a very small change in this number.

Pressure change (*p*) is a useful description of sound because most sound-detection devices use pressure as the mechanism to do the detection.

-  Our eardrums move because of the air pressure fluctuations, which then move the small bones in the middle ear.
-  Most microphones use a similar effect, converting pressure to an electrical signal (voltage or current).

The smallest pressure change that humans can hear is called *p*~0~ and equals

$$ p_0 = 2\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{Pa} = 20 \mathrm{\mu Pa}.$$

<!-- TODO figure -->

## Pressure, intensity, impedance
Last time we used intensity (*I*) as our measure of sound.  The relationship between intensity and pressure depends on details like the material and geometric details, which we call the *acoustic impedance* (*z*).

The units of impedance are pascals-seconds per meter (Pa s/m), also called "rayl".

If the impedance is known, intensity and pressure are related by the equation

$$ I = \frac{p^2}{z} $$

## Nominal acoustic impedance
For air at room temperature and pressure and in a large room away from any walls, the value of this impedance is called *z~0~*:

$$ z_0 = 413\,\mathrm{rayl} $$

By comparison, the impedance of water at room temperature is about *z*~water~=1.5&times;10^6^ rayl.

## Example: Thresholds of hearing
Recall from last time that the minimum sound intensity a typical adult human can hear is *I*~0~=10^-1^ W/m^2^.  This should be about what we get from the minimum pressure (*p*~0~=2&times;10^-5^ Pa) and the impedance of air (*z*~0~=413 Pa s/m).

$$\frac{p_0^2}{z_0} = \frac{(2\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{Pa})^2}{413\,\mathrm{Pa\,s/m}} = 9.7\times10^{-13}\,\mathrm{W/m^2}.$$

Rounding this up we get 1&times;10^-12^ W/m^2^, which is the value we called *I*~0~.

## More decibels
From last time our conversion from intensity *I* to *sound intensity level* in decibels (*S*~IL~) was

$$ S_{IL} = (10\,\mathrm{dB})\times \log\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right).$$

There is also a decibel measure for pressure, called *sound pressure level* (*S*~PL~) with a slightly different formula:

$$ S_{PL} = (20\,\mathrm{dB})\log\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right).$$

(Notice the *twenty* here instead of *ten* in the top equation.)

## *S*~PL~ or *S*~IL~?

All of this gets confusing, but the important thing is that in air *S*~IL~ and *S*~PL~ *have the same number value*.  For most of our applications, they can be used interchangeably.

So why do we have both?  When sound travels from one medium to another (or through complicated shapes), the *pressure is the same everywhere* even though the intensity is not.  This is the mathematical basis for impedance mismatches.

The pressure must stay the same because of Newton's 3rd Law of Motion (action/reaction), but the intensity going across the boundary is determined by the impedance formula.  Intensity must still be conserved (it's energy), so the intensity that doesn't make it across the boundary gets reflected out.

## Phons
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
A *phon* is a unit of **perceived** intensity, as determined by experiments.

Last time I showed this graph relating sound intensity to the limits of human hearing for different frequencies.

The [red]{style="color:red"} curve was the lowest sound that can be heard at that frequency.

*Phon* is the sound level relative to that red line, measured in decibels.
So, 0 phons is the loudness of points exactly on the red line.
20 phons is an intensity at the bottom blue line, and so on up the chart.

A similar graph is in the textbook as Figure 10-1.

## Adding several sources (same frequency)
The book makes this more confusing than it needs to be.  The rule is simple

> When combining multiple sound sources of the same frequency: **add the intensities**, not the sound levels (not the decibels).

So, if given the levels in decibels (either *S*~IL~ or *S*~PL~), convert to intensity, add the intensities, then convert back to decibels.

If you have *N* identical sources, then their combined sound level will be the level of one source (in dB) *plus* (10 log *N*).
