## Review: Partials of a *perfect* open tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an open tube is twice the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 2L $$

Higher harmonics fit a whole number of half-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{2L}{n},\qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{2L}.
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* half-closed tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an half-closed tube is *four times* the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 4L $$

Higher harmonics fit a *odd* number of quarter-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{4L}{n},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{4L},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.
