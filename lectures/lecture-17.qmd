# Human voice

## Anatomy

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The human vocal track is like a half-closed pipe with the vocal folds at the closed end and the mouth at the other end.
Key items include

- Diaphragm
- Lungs
- The vocal folds
- Tongue
- Lips
- Teeth

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* half-closed tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an half-closed tube is *four times* the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 4L $$

Higher harmonics fit a *odd* number of quarter-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{4L}{n},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{4L},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Formants

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
The partials in human voice are called "[formants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant)".

Because the human vocal tract has a complex shape and is "squishy", the resonances are not sharp like we get for strings or pipes.  Instead they are broad and moveable.

The formants are labeled from low to high frequency starting at F1.  There is no set mathematical relationship between the frequency values of the formants.

The relative frequency relationships between formants is how we distinguish the vowel sounds of human speech.

## It is our voice that makes us human

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Our voice is one of the key differences between humans and other species.  Our ability to generate a large range of tones, timbres, and sounds is what made the development of language possible.

Recently, researchers from Kyoto University identified the specific evolutionary change that enabled us to speak.
The key was the loss of air sacs around the vocal folds that other primate species use to amplify their voices.

By sacrificing loudness for flexibility, early hominids we able make more complex sounds and adjust both the pitch and timbre of their voices, ultimately leading to speech.

The need to produce and understand speech is in turn thought to be the evolutionary pressure that made our brains larger.

## Voice registers

Vocalists and speech pathologists have identified various modes of vibration for the vocal tract, called "registers".  Scientifically, the difference in the registers is the relative strength of the various formants.

From lowest frequency to highest these are (using the musical terms)

- Vocal fry or subharmonic voice
- Chest voice
- Head voice
- Falsetto
- Whistle voice

The difference these is in the specific way that the vocal folds are configured and which parts of them are vibrating.  The transition points in the context of singing are called [*passaggi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passaggio).

Whether "head voice" and "chest voice" are distinct is a topic of controversy. Speech pathologists usually combine these and call it "modal voice", but musicians use the terms above.

## Voice registers (female)

Here is a supercut of Ariana Grande demonstrating her range, going up in chromatic sequence.  Try to identify at which notes she changes registers (passggi).

## Musical voice type

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
In classical music voice is traditionally broken into four "[voice types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_type)" based on range:

- Soprano
- Alto
- Tenor
- Bass

There are numerous subcategories based on range, timbre, speed, etc., but these are harder to define objectively.

## Speech

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Speech and the way we produce the sounds of speech is a very complex topic.
All parts of the vocal tract contribute in the sounds we make when we speak.

The vowels sounds are perhaps the simplest to describe.
We distinguish the various vowel sounds mostly by the frequencies of the first two formants.

The top graph shows the formants for an average adult male speaker for the complete set of vowel sounds in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).

The bottom graphs shows the spectrogram for the English vowels i, u, and a.

## Group Activity

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Voice isn't the only sound our vocal tract can make.

Take a few minutes in groups to answer the following question:

*How does whistling work?*

Consider the following:

- What produces the initial sound?
- What determines the pitch?
- What experiments could we do to check if your answers are correct?
