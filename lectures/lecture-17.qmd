# Vibrating air columns

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* open tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an open tube is twice the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 2L $$

Higher harmonics fit a whole number of half-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{2L}{n},\qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{2L}.
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* half-closed tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an half-closed tube is *four times* the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 4L $$

Higher harmonics fit a *odd* number of quarter-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{4L}{n},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{4L},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

# Human voice

## Anatomy

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The human vocal track is like a half-closed pipe with the vocal folds at the closed end and the mouth at the other end.
Key items include

- Diaphragm
- Lungs
- The vocal folds
- Tongue
- Lips
- Teeth

## Voice registers

Vocalists and speech pathologists have identified various modes of vibration for the vocal tract, called "registers".

From lowest frequency to highest these are (using the musical terms)

- Vocal fry or subharmonic voice
- Chest voice
- Head voice
- Falsetto
- Whistle voice

The difference these is in the specific way that the vocal folds are configured and which parts of them are vibrating.  The transition points in the context of singing are called [*passaggio*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passaggio).

Whether "head voice" and "chest voice" are distinct is a topic of controversy. Speech pathologists usually combine these and call it "modal voice", but musicians use the terms above.

## Voice registers (female)

Here is a supercut of Ariana Grande demonstrating her range, going up in sequence.  Try to identify at which notes she changes registers.
