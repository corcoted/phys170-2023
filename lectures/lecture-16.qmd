## Daily Quiz

## Announcements

::: {.incremental}
- The mid-term progress report for your group project is due Friday.
- The next homework assignment will be posted tomorrow and will be due next Thursday (3/23).
  - Change of instructions: Homework will be due *on paper* in class on Thursday.

## Group project mid-way progress report 
- Due Friday, 10pm
- Each group should upload one file to Canvas
- Required items in your report: initial progress on
  - Description of the instrument and how you built it (photos are encouraged!)
  - Description of how the instrument produces sound (e.g. what is vibrating?)
  - What determines the fundamental frequency?
  - Description of how one plays the instrument:
    -  How do you change the pitch?  The intensity?  Can you sustain notes?
  - Frequency analysis (spectrum)
  - Include a bibliography with any references you used while designing, building, or analyzing your instrument.

Treat this as a proper term paper.  The document should be in proper academic form, using proper structure.

# Vibrating air columns

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* open tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an open tube is twice the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 2L $$

Higher harmonics fit a whole number of half-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{2L}{n},\qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{2L}.
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* half-closed tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an half-closed tube is *four times* the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 4L $$

Higher harmonics fit a *odd* number of quarter-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{4L}{n},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{4L},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Anharmonicity - end effects

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The partials of a perfect tube are equal to the harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the tube (although the half-closed tube is missing all of the even harmonics.)

This is really a mathematical ideal that omits one very important detail: what happens at the [ends of the tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_correction).

For a perfectly cylindrical tube, the end correction adds a small effective length to the tube of 0.6*r*, where *r* is the radius of the tube.  But for other shapes (e.g. a trumpet bell) the end correction depends on frequency.

Measurement of the end effects of cylindrical tubes of various lengths, from [M. E. Bacon and S. Torok, *Phys. Teach.* 49, 152 (2011)](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.3555499). *DL* is the additional effective length added to the tubes to match the resonance frequency formula.
