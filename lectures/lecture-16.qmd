# Vibrating air columns

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* open tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an open tube is twice the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 2L $$

Higher harmonics fit a whole number of half-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{2L}{n},\qquad n=1,2,3,\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{2L}.
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Review: Partials of a *perfect* half-closed tube

:::: {.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
The fundamental wavelength of an half-closed tube is *four times* the length of the tube:

$$ \lambda_1 = 4L $$

Higher harmonics fit a *odd* number of quarter-wavelengths into *L*:

$$ \lambda_n = \frac{\lambda_1}{n} = \frac{4L}{n},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots $$

To convert wavelength to frequency, we first need the speed of sound waves in air:
$$ v = 343\,\mathrm{m/s} \qquad\text{at room temperature }(20^\circ{}\mathrm{C})$$

This gives us the sequence of frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = n \frac{v}{4L},\qquad n=1, 3, 5\ldots
$$

These are the *partials* of the tube.

## Anharmonicity - End effects

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The partials of a perfect tube are equal to the harmonics of the fundamental frequency of the tube (although the half-closed tube is missing all of the even harmonics.)

This is really a mathematical ideal that omits one very important detail: what happens at the [ends of the tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_correction).

For a perfectly cylindrical tube, the end correction adds a small effective length to the tube of 0.6*r*, where *r* is the radius of the tube.  But for other shapes (e.g. a trumpet bell) the end correction depends on frequency.  This shifts the higher partials.

## Anharmonicity - Bore shape

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Broadly speaking, the shape of wind instruments falls into two categories related to the shape of the tube.

- **Cylindrical bore** instruments are shaped like a pipe (if you stretch them out).
  - Flute, recorder, organ pipe, trumpet, trombone
- **Conical bore** instruments are shaped like a cone.
  - Oboe, bassoon, saxophones, French horn

The equations for partials we had before assumed a cylindrical bore.  For the half-closed tubes (all the brass and reeds) with cylindrical bores, this means that the even partials are missing.

Conical bores are missing the destructive interference that kills the even harmonics, so all partials are present.

# Generating sound: mouthpiece physics

## Flutes: Embouchure hole
A flute is open at both ends.  The vibrations in the tube are initiated by turbulence as the air passes the embouchure hole.

## Reeded instruments: Bernoulli effect

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The reeds in clarinets and such vibrate because of the Bernoulli Effect.
The Bernoulli Effect says that fast moving air has a lower pressure than air at rest.

As you blow into the mouthpiece, the fast moving air blowing in creates a low pressure area, sucking the reed against the mouth piece.  Once the gap is closed, the air stops, the pressure is released, and the reed relaxes, opening the path again.

Each pulse of air goes down the instrument and is partially reflected by the impedance mismatch at the bell.  This pulse comes back and pushes against the reed, "mode-locking" the vibrations at the resonance frequency of the tube, much like the [Helmholtz wave](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/realsimple/travelingwaves/Helmholtz_Motion.html) of a bowed violin string.

## Demo exercise

Pencil, sticky note, blow

## Brass instruments: Buzzing lips

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The lips of a brass player work similarly to reeds, but the player can also control the tension of the lips.  The buzzing sound made by the lips is essentially filtered by the instrument to pick out the partials.  Just like with the reed, the air pressure pulse gets recycled through the instrument locking the lips to the right frequency.

# Pitch selection

## Harmonics
The sound source in wind instruments is a noisy buzz covering a broad spectrum of frequencies.  However, the player can adjust where the lowest frequency in the noise occurs.

The method varies by instrument type.  For woodwinds this can be done by overblowing.  For brass instruments, tightening the lips does the same job.

## Woodwinds: breaking the column

The finger holes and/or keys on woodwind instruments select the pitch by

- Changing the effective length of the tube and
- Selecting the locations of nodes and antinodes

## Brasses: changing the tube length

For brass instruments the method is more direct: we change the length of the tube.  This is obvious in a trombone:

![](figs/lecture-16/img_407.jpg)

For valved instruments, traditionally the three valves add a whole tone, semi tone, and 1.5 tone of length to the tube.  This is enough to reach all of the notes starting from the 3rd partial and up.

![](figs/lecture-16/img_410.jpg)

## Is it an elephant?

The classification of instruments is pretty arbitrary.  Basically we can take any combination of

- Sound generator
- Tube
- Pitch adjusting mechanism

and get an instrument.  This allows instrument makers to get more creative...

## Weekly reflection

Thinking about the last video, it begs the question "why do some instrument designs survive and become popular and other fail?"

Why do you think this happens?
