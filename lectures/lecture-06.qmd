## Daily Quiz
what are the *causes* of diffraction and interference?

# Interference
![](figs/lecture-06/mothwater.jpg)

## Definition of Interference
Unlike the book, I'm going to discuss interference first because we can then use these ideas to talk about diffraction.

**Interference** is the adding of waves with the same frequency/wavelength.

## Principle of Superposition
When two or more waves overlap at the same place, we add their *amplitudes* at that point.

## Phase difference
*Phase* is a measure of time difference bewteen two waves.
We measure it in "waves" or as an angle, with 1 wave = 360&#176;.

- Completely *constructive interference* happens at a phase difference of 0 waves or 0&#176;.
- Completely *destructive interference* happens at a phase difference of 1/2 wave or 180&#176;.
- In between we have *partial interference*.
- The pattern repeats after each whole wave or each 360&#176;.

# Diffraction

## Definition of Diffraction
I'm going to give a different definition of diffraciton than the book, but one that I think makes more sense.

*Diffraction* is the interference of a wave *with itself.*

All of the math we used for interference applies here, too, if we look at the wave in the right way.

## Hugyen's Principle

*Huygens's Principle* is the idea that we can treat each point along a wavefront as its own point source. Looks for the constructive interference of these imaginary point sources let's use determine the shape of the wave as it propagates.
