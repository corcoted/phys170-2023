## Daily Quiz
- What *causes* diffraction?
- What *causes* interference?

# Interference
![](figs/lecture-06/mothwater.jpg)

## Definition of Interference
Unlike the book, I'm going to discuss interference first because we can then use these ideas to talk about diffraction.

**Interference** is the adding of waves with the same frequency/wavelength.

## Principle of Superposition
When two or more waves overlap at the same place, we add their *amplitudes* at that point.

## Phase difference
*Phase* is a measure of time difference between two waves.
We measure it in "waves" or as an angle, with 1 wave = 360&#176;.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Completely *constructive interference* happens at a phase difference of 0 waves or 0&#176;.
- Completely *destructive interference* happens at a phase difference of 1/2 wave or 180&#176;.
- In between we have *partial interference*.
- The pattern repeats after each whole wave or each 360&#176;.

## Calculating phase difference

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
To calculate the phase difference between two sources we do:

- Measure the distance from each source to the listener (call these _d_~1~ and _d_~2~).
- Divide the difference in distances by the wavelength (&lambda;), then multiply by 360&#176;:<br /> $\phi = \frac{d_1 - d_2}{\lambda}\times 360^\circ$
- In these drawings, the wavelength is &lambda;&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;m.

# Diffraction

## Definition of Diffraction
I'm going to give a different definition of diffraction than the book, but one that I think makes more sense.

*Diffraction* is the interference of a wave *with itself.*

All of the math we used for interference applies here, too, if we look at the wave in the right way.

## Hugyen's Principle

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
*Huygens's Principle* is the idea that we can treat each point along a wavefront as its own point source. Looks for the constructive interference of these imaginary point sources let's use determine the shape of the wave as it propagates.

## Diffraction compared to wavelength
Diffraction happens when waves pass through a hole that is similar in size to the wavelength.

## Diffraction from a slit

:::: { .columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
For a slit or rectangular hole, the sound is concentrated in a cone with angular width &theta; given by

$$\sin\theta = \frac{\lambda}{D}$$

where &lambda; is the wavelength and _D_ is the size of the hole.  Solving for the angle we have

$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{\lambda}{D}\right)$$

## Diffraction from a circular hole

:::: { .columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
For a circular hole, the result is similar but the formula has an extra factor of 1.22:

$$\sin\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}$$

where &lambda; is the wavelength and _D_ is the diameter of the hole.  Solving for the angle we have

$$\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}\right)$$

## Phased array

:::: { .columns }
::: { .column width="60%"}
We can find the diffraction patterns of other shapes by going back to [Huygen's Principle](#hugyens-principle) of treating each point as a new source.  With proper engineering we can control both the amplitude and phase of each point of the new wave.

For example, if we set up a line of speakers and control the phase of each, we have a [*phased array*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array).  This can be used to control the direction of sound emitted by the speakers ("beam steering").

Near the source, the wave is mixed up, but after a few wavelengths, the shape becomes apparent.

## Diffusors

For example, some *acoustic diffusors* are actually diffraction devices.

![](figs/lecture-06/GIK-Acoustics-Alpha-Series-Plate-Scattering-Options.jpg)

The complex patterns here cause the sound to scatter in quasi-random directions because of diffraction.  Each hard surface acts like an individual source of sound.  The complex pattern mixes up the sound so that it doesn't reflect directly.
