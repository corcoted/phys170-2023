## Fidelity

*Fidelity* is a measure of how accurately the output sound matches the input sound.
This is an objective measurement: we can define it using math.

Often the word "fidelity" is used colloquially to mean "subjectively sounds good."
Much of the debate about the quality of recordings or amplifiers is really about personal preference, not mathematical accuracy.

Key aspects of fidelity are

- minimal noise
- minimal distortion (we'll define this later)
- flat frequency response

## Waveforms

The *waveform* of a sound is a plot of pressure changes over time.

In practice we use a microphone to convert the pressure into an electric signal (current or voltage), and that is what we display.
