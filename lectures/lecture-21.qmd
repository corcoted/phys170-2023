## Analog sound chain

## Fidelity

*Fidelity* is a measure of how accurately the output sound matches the input sound.
This is an objective measurement: we can define it using math.

Often the word "fidelity" is used colloquially to mean "subjectively sounds good."
Much of the debate about the quality of recordings or amplifiers is really about personal preference, not mathematical accuracy.

Key aspects of fidelity are

- minimal noise
- minimal distortion (we'll define this later)
- flat frequency response

## Waveforms

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The *waveform* of a sound is a plot of pressure changes over time.  I'll represent it mathematically as $y(t)$.

In practice we use a microphone to convert the pressure into an electric signal (current or voltage), and that is what we display.

## Frequency Power Spectrum

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

The waveform tells us about the sound signal at any instant in time, but here we need to understand the broad characteristics of a sound and how they are affected by the transmission and reproduction process.

The most common mathematical tool is the Frequency Power Spectrum, which is defined as

$$
P(f) = \left| \int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty y(t) e^{2\pi i ft} \,dt\right|^2
$$

This is the magnitude-squared of the Fourier Transform of the waveform.

In practice the power spectrum is estimated using digital techniques, which we'll talk about in the next lecture.
