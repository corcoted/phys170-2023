## Analog and Digital

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
An *analog* signal is something that changes smoothly over time and space. Mathematically, analog signals are represented by *functions* of *real numbers*. - A *digital* signal comes in countable pieces. Mathematically, digital signals are represented by *sequences* of *integers*.

Digital representations of analog signals are inherently approximations.

An analog signal (gray) and its approximation as a digital sequence (red).  The red dots can only be placed where the dashed lines cross.  This causes *digitization errors*.

## Digitizing Waveforms

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Converting an analog signal (e.g. voltage varying over time) to digital requires chopping the signal up in both time and amplitude. Usually the spacing on both time and amplitude is even.

This conversion process is called *sampling*.

-   The *time step* (*T*) is the time between samples.
-   The *sampling rate* (*f~s~*) is the number of time steps in one second (e.g. 40000 samples per second). $f_s=1/T$
-   The *bit depth* (*b*) gives the number of steps in amplitude

## Review: Digitization errors

Digitization error is a loss in fidelity caused by the digitization process.

- *Sampling errors* are errors in time. For example: uneven time steps or too-low sampling rate
- *Quantization errors* are errors in amplitude. For example: low bit-depth or uneven amplitude steps

The bad reputation of digital audio among audiophiles is likely because early equipment (up through the 1970s) was susceptible to these types of errors.  Modern digital hardware (even cheap hardware) has much greater fidelity than the comparable analog gear.
:::

::: {}
Also, because digital signals can be easily processed in *software*, many types of digitization errors can be cleaned up in post-processing if higher bit-depth and sampling rates are used.
The computer power to do this wasn't available in the early days of digital audio.

## Review: Sampling Rates and the Nyquist frequency

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60% }
To faithfully represent an analog signal containing frequencies up to some *f*~max~, the data must be sample rate must be at least twice *f*~max~.  This is the "[Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)".  The *Nyquist frequency* *f~N~* is simply

$$
f_N = 2f_\text{max}.
$$

Sampling at a rate less than *f~N~* is called *undersampling* and causes a type of distortion called *aliasing*, introducing false frequencies into the signal.

Sampling at a rate greater than *f~N~* is called *oversampling*.  This doesn't give any additional fidelity, but is often done to provide a buffer for later digital processing.

# Digital signal processing

## Time Domain and Frequency Domain

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Digital signal processing can be separated in to two categories of techniques:

- **Time domain** works on the waveform, treating it as a list of amplitudes that change in time
- **Frequency domain** works on the spectrum, treating the signal as a list of (complex-number) amplitudes at each frequency

Mathematically, the two categories are equivalent by [Fourier's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis), but some processes are easier to implement in one domain or the other.

## Discrete Fourier Transform

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {style="font-size:85%"}
For digital data, conversion of the data between the time and frequency domains is done using the [*Discrete Fourier Transform*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) or DFT.

Let's call a waveform consisting of _N_ samples, {*x~n~*}, with *n* labeling the sample number (*n* = 0...*N*-1).

The amplitude spectrum {*X~k~*} is a list of amplitudes at various frequency samples *k* (*k* = 0...*N*-1):

$$
X_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\pi nk/N}.
$$
Here, $i$ is the imaginary number $i=\sqrt{-1}$.

To go from spectrum to waveform, we do a similar calculation:
$$
x_n = \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} X_k e^{+i2\pi nk/N}.
$$

One particular way of coding this is called the [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).

## Spectrograms and Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
The DFT uses the whole waveform to calculate the spectrum.  If we chop the waveform into shorter pieces, calculate the DFT of each piece, and then glue them back together like a quilt, we have the *Discrete-Time Fourier Transform* (DTFT), which is often displayed as a *spectrogram*.

## Sampling rate and bandwidth

We discussed earlier that the Nyquist limit sets the minimum on the sampling rate needed to faithfully reproduce a waveform.

A similar limit relates the sampling time *T* with the frequency resolution of the spectrum *&delta;f* calculated using DFT or DTFT.

$$
\delta f = \frac{1}{2\pi T}.
$$

The is particularly important for spectrograms: smaller time slices gives you poorer frequency resolution.
