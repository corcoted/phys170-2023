# Percussion Instruments

## Definition

It's hard to define percussion. Depending on the context it might mean:

- Instruments that are struck or banged or otherwise are activated in an impulsive way.
- Instruments whose primary mode of sound generation is a vibrating solid body (as opposed to a string or an air column).
- Anything played by the percussionists in the orchestra.

## Building a xylophone

Building a xylophone blog series by Kate Salesin (Nov. 2020)

- <https://medium.com/@kas493/building-a-xylophone-part-1-xylo-troduction-a9e914ddaa13>{ data-preview-link="false" }

Read through this and answer the following questions:

- Why is the author building a xylophone?
- What is her plan for designing and building the instrument?
- What factors determine the size and shape of the bars?  Why is she doing the simulations?
- What does she mean by "tuning the partials"?  Why does she want to do this?
- How is the tuning of the partials accomplished?
- How does she mount the bars?  Why did she place the string where she did?

## My favorite use of percussion

Tchaikovsky, *1812 Overture*, performed by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force Eastern Army Band, MAJ Shiga T≈çru conducting, Oct. 2010, Asaka, Japan.
