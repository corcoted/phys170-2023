## Initial plan
Due before Spring Break (Feb. 24, 10pm) on Canvas

- What is the instrument?
- What is each person's role? (See next slide)
- How are you going to communicate with each other?
- When are you going to meet to work on this?
- How are you dividing the work among the group members?
- How are you going to store and share your work with each other?

## Group Roles
As part of the initial plan, each role below must be assigned to one group member.

::: {style="font-size:80%"}
- **Manager/Facilitator:** Manages the group by helping to ensure that the group stays on task, is focused, and that everyone participates.  Organizes meetings and sends communications to the group.  Responsible for submitting reports using Canvas.
- **Recorder/Archivist:** Keeps notes about the group's work and shares them with the group.  Takes primary role in the written reports; may delegate writing work to others.
- **Spokesperson/Presenter**: Will MC the final presentation (but everyone must help present). The Spokesperson should rely on the recorder’s notes to guide their report.  Also responsible for communicating with Dr. C as issues arise.
- **Questioner/Strategy Analyst/Technical Analyst**: Focusses on the big picture.  Ensures everyone's ideas being incorporated. Plays "Devil's Advocate" in discussions.  Takes the lead in technical discussions.

## Requirements for the instrument

- Must be a tonal instrument (produces well-defined pitches)
- Must play multiple pitches in a controlled way
  - At least an octave of a pentatonic scale (e.g. C D E G A C)
- You must build it yourselves
- You must be able to explain how it works
- Purely electronic instruments are not acceptable (e.g. a synth would be out, but an electric guitar is okay)

## Final report contents
More details will follow

- Description of the instrument and how you built it
- Description of how the instrument produces sound (e.g. what is vibrating?)
- What determines the fundamental frequency
- Description of how one plays the instrument
  -  How do you change the pitch?  The intensity?  Can you sustain notes?
- Frequency analysis (spectrum)

The midway report (3/17) will contain initial results on all of these topics.

Rough draft of the complete final report is due 3/24.

## Final presentation
More details will follow

- Summary of the items in the written report
- Demonstration of the instrument and how it is played
  - Show how to change pitch/intensity/sustain (if applicable)
  - Play a simple melody of your choosing

# Vibrating solid bodies
TLDR: The vibration modes depend on the details of the structure, but a few general patterns exist.

## Types of vibrating solid bodies

::: {.columns}

- Reeds
- Bars, tubes (struck), rods
- Plates
- Membranes

## Vibration modes of a solid body

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Transverse: like a string
- Longitudinal: stretch and compress
- Torsional: twisting

For most solid bodies the transverse modes are the dominant ones.

## Bars, rods, tubes
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
These are generally percussion instruments that are struck with a mallet: glockenspiel, xylophone, chimes.

The fundamental mode is a transverse vibration.  If the width of the bar is *w* and its length is *&ell;*, then the fundamental frequency goes like
$$
f_1 = k \frac{w}{\ell^2},
$$
where *k* is a number that depends on the material properties and the specifics of the geometry (round, square, etc.).

## Modes of bars

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The vibrational modes of long bars look similar to the modes of strings, but the loops are not of equal length.

This makes the partials *inharmonic*.  If the fundamental mode has frequency *f*~1~, then the next few modes are
2.76*f*~1~, 5.40*f*~1~, 8.93*f*~1~, 13.34*f*~1~.

The bars in glockenspiel, marimbas, etc., are mounted at the nodes of the fundamental, a little outside of 1/4 of the way from the ends, in order to suppress the higher partials.

## Reeds

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size:80%"}
Here we're talking about reeds that vibrate at their natural frequency, like in an accordion or harmonica, not a reed in a woodwind instrument.

The difference between a "reed" and a "bar" is that one end of a reed is clamped or held in place as it vibrates.

The fundamental mode is a transverse vibration, just like bars, and the equation is the same.  If the thickness of the reed is *t* and its length is *&ell;*, then the fundamental frequency goes like
$$
f_1 = k \frac{t}{\ell^2},
$$
where *k* is a number that depends on the material properties.
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Lowest 3 modes of a vibrating reed](figs/lecture-12/img_255.jpg)

::: {style="font-size:70%"}
The next two modes are at
$f_2 = 6.25 f_1$ and $f_3 = 17.5 f_1$

## Plates and membranes
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
These are both thin flat objects.  The details of the vibrational structures depend on the details of the shape how the object is mounted.

The bodies of string instruments are plates in this sense, as well as things like cymbals and gongs.

There aren't any general equations for the frequencies, so you have to look on a case-by-case basis.
