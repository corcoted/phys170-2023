## Initial plan
Due before Spring Break (Feb. 24, 10pm) on Canvas

- What is the instrument?
- What is each person's role? (See next slide)
- How are you going to communicate with each other?
- When are you going to meet to work on this?
- How are you dividing the work among the group members?
- How are you going to store and share your work with each other?

## Group Roles
As part of the initial plan, each role below must be assigned to one group member.

- **Manager/Facilitator:** Manages the group by helping to ensure that the group stays on task, is focused, and that everyone participates.  Organizes meetings and sends communications to the group.
- **Recorder/Archivist:** Keeps notes about the group's work and shares them with the group.  Takes primary role in the written reports; may delegate writing work to others.
- **Spokesperson/Presenter**: Will MC the final presentation (but everyone must help present). The Spokesperson should rely on the recorderâ€™s notes to guide their report.  Also responsible for communicating with Dr. C as issues arise.
- **Questioner/Strategy Analyst/Technical Analyst**: Focusses on the big picture.  Ensures everyone's ideas being incorporated. Plays "Devil's Advocate" in discussions.  Takes the lead in technical discussions.

## Requirements for the instrument

- Must be a tonal instrument (produces well-defined pitches)
- Must play multiple pitches in a controlled way
  - At least an octave of a pentatonic scale (e.g. C D E G A C)
- You must build it yourselves
- You must be able to explain how it works
- Purely electronic instruments are not acceptable (e.g. a synth would be out, but an electric guitar is okay)

## Final report contents
More details will follow

- Description of the instrument and how you built it
- Description of how the instrument produces sound (e.g. what is vibrating?)
- What determines the fundamental frequency
- Description of how one plays the instrument
  -  How do you change the pitch?  The intensity?  Can you sustain notes?
- Frequency analysis (spectrum)

The midway report (3/17) will contain initial results on all of these topics.

Rough draft of the complete final report is due 3/24.

## Final presentation
More details will follow

- Summary of the items in the written report
- Demonstration of the instrument and how it is played
  - Show how to change pitch/intensity/sustain (if applicable)
