## Exam Discussion

# Architectural Acoustics

## Sound environment

Sound has to travel from the source to our ears (or a microphone) before we hear it.
Many aspects of the environment can affect the sound we receive.

- Time delay
- Attenuation
- Multi-path effects
  - Echos
  - Reflections
  - Reverberation
- External noise

## Time delay

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}

This one is straight-forward.  Sound travels at a certain speed.  For our standard of dry, room-temperature air, the speed of sound is v = 343 m/s.

There are a few consequences of this

- Listeners farther away will hear the sound slightly later
- If the sound source is spread over a larger area, "phasing" will occur that depends on the location of the listener.

### Example

The band director is standing on the 50-yard line on the sideline.  What is the time delay that she hears between the snare drum right in front of her, 5 meters away, and a piccolo player near the end zone, 50 meters away?

## Attenuation

A sound travels, some of the sound energy will be transformed into heat because of friction between molecules.
