# Frequency and Pitch

## Pitch
*Pitch* is the musical term for the identity of a musical tone in terms of its fundamental partial.
The identification of pitch is a rich topic itself with lots of ties to history and culture.

We're going to keep a very basic definition of pitch and define it as the way we distinguish keys on a piano.

![](figs/lecture-13/piano.webp){fig-align="center"}

One octave of a piano keyboard looks like the picture here. The white keys are given names in a repeating pattern using letters A through G, and the black keys are named equally as the neighboring white key to the left plus "sharp" (&sharp;) or the white key to the right plus "flat" (&flat;).  The fact that, for example, B^&flat;^ and A^&sharp;^ are the same key is called *enharmonicity,* but as we'll see later, this is because of our choice of the way the piano is tuned.

## Octaves on the piano keys

The pattern of 7 white keys and 5 black keys repeats in sets called "octaves."  Each octave has 12 keys.  We'll label the octaves with a number.  By tradition, the C closest to the middle of the piano keyboard is called "middle C" and we'll give it the name C~4~.  The next C to the left on the keyboard ("lower") we call C~3~, and the C to the right of middle C ("higher") is called C~5~.

Each new octave number begins at C.  The key to the left of C~4~ is called B~3~.

## Absolute pitch
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
By [international treaty](https://www.iso.org/standard/3601.html)(!!) the key A~4~ on the piano (above middle C) is tuned such that its fundamental partial has a frequency of 440\ Hz.  This is called the "standard concert pitch".  There is a rich history of the various disputes around this value (mostly political soap operas between various nations, orchestras, and composers, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_pitch_standards_in_Western_music)), even making an appearance in the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I.

The modern value is attributed to German physicist Johann Scheibler who presented the first reliable measurements of musical frequencies at a conference in Stuttgart in 1834, with the value A~4~\ =\ 440\ Hz first being recognized as an international standard in 1939 and then reaffirmed in 1975.

# Intervals and scales

## Octaves

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
Going back to our discussion of vibrating strings, we saw that the fundamental frequency of the string was given by
$$
f_1 = \frac{1}{2L}\,\sqrt{\frac{F}{m}},
$$
and that the first overtone is at exactly 2 times this frequency: $f_2 = 2f_1$.

We say that two frequencies with this relationship are an *octave* apart.  Or, in terms of their ratios:
$$
\text{octave} = 2:1
$$

When played together, human hearing will interpret these as the same pitch.

## Octaves of A's

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
If we take as a starting point A~4~\ =\ 440\ Hz, we can use our definition of octave to calculate the frequencies of all of the other A's on the piano keyboard by successively multiplying or dividing by two.

This is called a *geometric sequence* in math.  Rather than adding or subtracting to go from one pitch to the next, we multiply or divide.

To find the frequencies of the other pitches, we need a mathematical rule.  Historically, many different rules, called *temperments* or *tunings* were used.  We'll start with the most common modern rule: *equal temperment*.

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

| Pitch | Frequency (Hz) |
|------|------|
| A~0~ | 27.5  |
| A~1~ | 55  |
| A~2~ | 110 | 
| A~3~ | 220 |
| A~4~ | 440  |
| A~5~ | 880  |
| A~6~ | 1760 | 
| A~7~ | 3520 |

## Equal temperament
The rule for the 12-tone equal tempered scale (12-TET) simply says that *the ratio of frequencies of adjacent keys on the piano must be the same for every pair of keys.*

Let's do a little algebra.  If the ratio between adjacent keys is called *x*, then after 12 keys we should have an octave, or two times the starting frequency:
$$
f_1 \times x^{12} = 2f_1
$$
Solving for *x* gives the ratio between adjacent keys:
$$
x = \sqrt[12]{2} \approx 1.059463\ldots
$$
In words, the ratio is the twelfth root of 2.  We can also write this as $2^{1/12}$,<br />2 to the 1/12th power, which is easier to do algebra with.

This interval is called a *semitone* of the equal-tempered scale.

## Examples

![](figs/lecture-13/piano.webp){ fig-align="center" width="25%"}

::: fragment
The frequency of A^&sharp;^~4~ is
$$
A^\sharp_4 = A_4\times 2^{1/12} = 440\,\mathrm{Hz}\times 2^{1/12} = 466.2\,\mathrm{Hz}.
$$
:::

::: fragment
To get A^&flat;^~4~ we divide by $\sqrt[12]{2}$:
$$
A^\flat_4 = \frac{A_4}{2^{1/12}} = 415.3\,\mathrm{Hz}
$$
:::

::: fragment
To get C~5~, we step up by 3 keys on the keyboard:
$$
C_5 = A_4 \times (2^{1/12})^3  = A_4\times 2^{1/4} = 440\,\mathrm{Hz}\times1.189=523\,\mathrm{Hz}
$$

## Full equal tempered chromatic scale

![](figs/lecture-13/img_301.jpg){ width="60%" fig-align="center"}

Stepping one note at a time across the keyboard (including the black keys), we get the full 12-tone chromatic scale.

Again, the defining characteristic of the equal tempered scale is that the frequency ratios of adjacent notes is the same: $2^{1/2} \approx 1.059463$.

## Cents
Because multiplying and dividing frequency numbers is inconvenient, we often characterize pitch in terms of a measure called *cents* that we can add or subtract.  Cents live on a logarithmic scale, such that adding 1200 cents doubles the frequency.
Adding or subtracting 100 cents moves us by one semitone (one piano key) up or down on the equal tempered scale.

If we have two frequencies, their difference in cents from *f*~1~ to *f*~2~ is given by
$$
\mathrm{cents} = 1200 \log_2 (f_2/f_1).
$$
Where "log~2~" means the base-2 logarithm.  Most calculators can't do this directly, so using some math rules for logs we get the equation
$$
\mathrm{cents} = \frac{1200}{\log 2} \log (f_2/f_1)
\approx 3986 \log(f_1/f_2).
$$

(This should remind you of decibels.  The math is very similar.)

## Cents to frequency

Going the other way, if we know *f*~1~ and want to change by a number of cents, the new frequency *f*~2~ is
$$
f_2 = f_1 \times 2^{\mathrm{cents}/1200},
$$
where "cents" is positive to go higher in pitch or negative to go lower in pitch.

For example, if we're trying to play A~4~ and our electronic tuner says we're flat by 30 cents, our actual frequency is
$$
f = (440\,\mathrm{Hz})\times 2^{-30/1200} = (440\,\mathrm{Hz})\times(0.983) = 432\,\mathrm{Hz}
$$

Another example, say we're trying to play C~4~ (262\ Hz) and our measured frequency is 256\ Hz.  How far off are we in cents?
$$
 \frac{1200}{\log 2}\,\log\left(\frac{256\,\mathrm{Hz}}{262\,\mathrm{Hz}}\right) = -30\,\mathrm{cents}\text{ (flat)}
$$

## MIDI pitch values
[*MIDI*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) is a computer language for describing music.  Pitch values for MIDI start with A~4~\ =\ 69, and go up or down by one step for each key on the piano.  In other words, 1 MIDI pitch unit = 100 cents.

To go from MIDI pitch *p* to frequency *f* do
$$
f = (440\,\mathrm{Hz})\times 2^{(p-69)/12} = (8.175\,\mathrm{Hz})\times 2^{p/12}
$$

To go from frequency to MIDI pitch
$$
p = \frac{12}{\log 2}\log\left(\frac{f}{8.175\,\mathrm{Hz}}\right)
= 39.86 \log\left(\frac{f}{8.175\,\mathrm{Hz}}\right)
$$

## Just intervals
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The equal tempered scale is used for modern instruments because of its versatility, but it sacrifices perfect harmony.  From our discussion of harmonic and inharmonic partials, we know that the best-sounding frequency combinations come as simple fractions.

These are called *just intervals*.  Notice in the table that (1) these are not powers of $2^{1/12}$ in frequency or (2) an even number of 100 cents.

This means that the equal-tempered scale of the piano is off by a tiny bit.  This is the cost paid for being able to play music written in any key equally well.

## Comparison of just intervals and equal-tempered intervals

## Pythagorean scales
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
If we try to build scales using just intonation, we have to make comprising about which intervals to preserve.  

One of the earliest methods was the *Pythagorean* scale.  This is made by choosing a starting pitch (e.g. A~4~\ =\ 440\ Hz) and going up or down in perfect fifths (3/2 ratio = 702 cents), then dropping or raising by octaves as needed to build the A~4~ major scale.  This automatically includes the perfect fourths as well.

Extending this idea to all 12 tones is called "five-limit tuning".

![](figs/lecture-13/img_290.jpg)

![](figs/lecture-13/img_292.jpg)

::: {style="font-size:80%"}
The root cause is that no number of perfect fifths add up to a whole number of octaves.  Algebraically, there is no solution to the equation
$$
(3/2)^x = 2^y,
$$
where both *x* and *y* are whole numbers.

## Just diatonic scale
If we use the same method as the Pythagorean scale but allow major and minor thirds, we get the *just diatonic scale*, which is the most harmonious 12-tone scale, in the sense of being closest to just for each note.

![](figs/lecture-13/img_295.jpg) ![](figs/lecture-13/img_296.jpg)

This works great for instruments with adjustable pitch (especially human voice or strings in most keys), but doesn't work for things like pianos because it depends on picking one specific key in which the music is played (e.g. A-major starting from A~4~).
