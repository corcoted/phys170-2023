# Resonances in pipes

## Review: Resonances in strings
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
A string of length *L* that is clamped on both ends will resonate at the wavelengths

$$
\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}
$$
with frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n}=n\frac{v}{2L}= n\,\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{F}{m}},
$$
where *v* is the wave speed on the string,<br />*F* is the tension force on the string,<br />and *m* is the mass per length of the string.

## Open pipes
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
A pipe that is open on both ends has the same resonance structure as a clamped string:
$$
\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}
$$
with frequencies
$$
f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n}=n\frac{v}{2L},
$$
where *v* is now the speed of sound in air (about 350 m/s).

Note that the width of the pipe has very little effect on the frequency.

These curves show the air speed.  Nodes are where the air does not move, and antinodes are where the air vibrates the most.

## Half-closed pipes
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
A pipe that is closed on one end will have a node at the closed end. For the fundamental mode, only a quarter of a wave fits inside the tube.
$$
\lambda_1 = 4L \quad \rightarrow \quad f_1 = \frac{v}{4L}
$$

This means the fundamental frequency of a tube is halved when you close one end. Or in musical terms, *a closed tube is one octave lower than an open tube of the same length.*

Also, only odd harmonics give us the right combinations of nodes and antinodes:
$$
f_n = n\,\frac{v}{4L}\quad\text{($n$ is odd)}
$$

## Selecting pitch
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Because open ends of a tube give the location of anti-nodes in the vibration, wind instruments can change their pitch by opening holes in the side of the tube wherever antinodes are desired.  This is also why the fingering for woodwinds can seem random: it's not just changing the length, but adding interior antinodes as well.

# Speed of sound in gases

## Speed of sound: factors
We've been casually passing around numbers for the speed of sound in air between 340 and 350 m/s.

The actual value of speed of sound in a gas depends on many factors:

- the mass of the gas molecules
- the molecular structure
- the pressure of the gas
- the temperature
- if the gas is a mixture or not

## Speed of sound: important trends
The table in the book is basically useless because you need much more information to calculate the speed, but the basic trends are that *speed increases* when

- ambient pressure increases
- the temperature increases
- the average molecular mass decreases
  - e.g. humidity of air increases (water weighs less than nitrogen or oxygen)

For dry air, the most relevant thing is the temperature dependence.  A [good approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound#Speed_of_sound_in_ideal_gases_and_air) is

$$
v_\text{dry air} \approx (331.3 + 0.606\,T)\,\mathrm{\tfrac{m}{s}}
$$
where the temperature *T* is in Celsius (e.g. *T*=20&deg;C is room temperature).

## Speed of Sound in other gases: Details
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:80%"}
*This page is bonus material.*

A more detailed formula for the speed of sound in gas is given by

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{K p}{d}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{KRT}{M}}
$$

- *K* is adiabatic compressibility (about 1.4 for air)
- *p* is gas pressure (101325 Pa)
- *d* is gas density (in kg/m^3^)
- *T* is temperature (in Kelvin, 293 K for room temp.)
- *R* is molar gas constant (8.314 J/mol K)
- *M* is molecular mass of the gas (in kg/mol)

# Producing sound in pipes

## Turbulence creates vibrations
In flutes, recorders, whistles, and [organ flue pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flue_pipe), the air inside the tube starts vibrating because of turbulence, which is chaotic motion of the air.  The frequencies in the turbulence that fail to match the resonances of the tube get suppressed.

## Reeded and brass instruments 
::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The vibrations of the reeds in woodwinds and organ reed pipes adjust to match the partials of the pipes because of *positive feedback*.
As the air in the pipe starts vibrating, the pulses come back to the mouthpiece at just the right time to push back on the reed, forcing it to only vibrate at the resonant frequencies.

The vibrations of a brass player's lips work the same way: positive feedback from the air impulses forces the lips to vibrate resonantly with one of the partials of the instrument.
