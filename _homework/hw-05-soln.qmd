12 points total, 2 points each

## Problem 1

(6 points) Calculate the frequencies for the 8 pitches in one octave of a major scale starting from a bottom note with a frequency of 120.0 Hz (a very sharp B^♭^~2~) using the following temperaments:

-   Just temperament
-   12-tone equal temperament

The table below has a couple of values to get you started. Complete the rest. Give your answers to the first decimal place.

|                | B^♭^     | C       | D       | E^♭^    | F     | G       | A       | B^♭^  |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Just tempered  | 120.0 Hz | *135.0* | *150.0* | *160.0* | 180.0 | *200.0* | *225.0* | 240.0 |
| Equal tempered | 120.0 Hz | *134.7* | *151.2* | *160.2* | 179.8 | *201.8* | *226.5* | 240.0 |

### Solution

The final values are given in italics above.

#### Just temperament scale
The just-tempered scale uses various frequency ratios using small numbers. These can be found in the textbook in Table 14-4:

![W&W Table 14-4: Just diatonic scale](figs/hw-05/just-scale.jpg){ width="50%"}

Here, *f* is the frequency of the starting note. For us, $f=120.0\,\mathrm{Hz}$. Multiplying *f* by the fractions in the second row of the table gives the correct frequencies (shown above).

#### Equal temperament scale
Twelve-tone equal temperament means that each semi-tone has the frequency of the one below it, times $2^{1/12} \approx 1.05946$.  Each whole-tone step is the square of this number: $2^{2/12}=2^{1/6} \approx 1.2246$.  Starting from the bottom and going up in a major scale (whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half), gives us the numbers above.

For example, C is a whole step above B^♭^, so we get its frequency by

$$ 120.0 \times 2^{2/12} \approx 120.0\times 1.2246 \approx 134.7. $$

The other values can be calculated the same way.

## Problem 2
(2 points) The previous problem started with a "B^♭^~2~" (scare quotes) with a frequency of 120 Hz. The correct frequency of a B^♭^~2~ on the usual equal-tempered scale is 116.6 Hz. What is the difference in these two pitches, measured in cents?

### Solution
The formula for comparing frequency $f_2$ to a reference $f_1$ in centss

$$ \textrm{cents} = \frac{1200}{\log 2}\,\log\left(\frac{f_2}{f_1} \right) $$

Putting our numbers ($f_1 = 120\,\mathrm{Hz}$ and $f_2 = 116.6\,\mathrm{Hz}$) we get

$$ \frac{1200}{\log 2}\,\log\left(\frac{116.6}{120.0} \right) = -49.8\,\textrm{cents},$$

So, our note is about 50 cents flat.

## Problem 3
(2 points) The stops on a pipe organ are traditionally labeled by the length of the C pipe in that register, measured in feet (1 foot = 0.3048 meters).  What is the frequency of the fundamental for an open pipe that is 8 feet long?  (Assume the speed of sound in air is 343 m/s).

### Solution
The equation for the fundamental of an open pipe is

$$ f = \frac{v}{2L}. $$

For this problem, $v=343\,\mathrm{m/s}$ is the speed of sound in air at room temperature.  The length of the pipe is 8 feet, but we need to convert this to meters before inserting it into the frequency equation:

$$ L = (8\,\mathrm{ft})(0.3048\,\mathrm{m/ft}) = 2.44\,\mathrm{m}. $$

Inserting this length into the equation above gives

$$ f = \frac{v}{2L}=\frac{343\,\mathrm{m/s}}{2(2.44\,\mathrm{m})} = 70.3\,\mathrm{Hz}, $$

which is roughly a C~2~ pitch.

## Problem 4
(2 point) Suppose we are making a set of glockenspiel bars.  The lowest-pitched bar has a length of 20 cm.  How long is a bar of the same thickness that plays an octave higher?

### Solution
The equation for the fundamental frequency of a thin bar is given by Eq. 13a of White:

$$ f = k\frac{t}{\ell^2}, $$

where $k$ depends on the material properties, $t$ is the thickness of the bar, and $\ell$ is the length of the bar.

In our case, we don't know the numbers for $k$ and $t$, but we know that they are the same for both bars.

Let's call the frequency of the first bar $f_1$ and the frequency of the second bar $f_2$.  The length of the first bar is $\ell_1 = 20\,\mathrm{cm} = 0.20\,\mathrm{m}$ and the length of the second bar $\ell_2$ is unknown.  This gives us two equations:
$$
f_1 = k\frac{t}{\ell_1^2},\qquad\text{and}\qquad f_2 = k\frac{t}{\ell_2^2}
$$

The other piece of information is that bar 2 is an octave higher than bar 1.  In terms of frequency this means that $f_2 = 2f_1$.  We can use the frequency equation above and substitute the expressions for $f_1$ and $f_2$ into the octave equation:
$$
 f_2 = 2f_1\qquad\rightarrow\qquad k\frac{t}{\ell_2^2}=2\left(k\frac{t}{\ell_1^2}\right) .
$$
Rearranging to solve for the unknown length $\ell_2$, we get (skipping a few algebra steps)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell_2^2 &= \frac{kt}{2 \left(k\frac{t}{\ell_1^2}\right)} = \frac{\ell^2_1}{2}, \\
\ell_2 &= \frac{\ell_1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{0.20\,\mathrm{m}}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.14\,\mathrm{m}.
\end{aligned}
$$
