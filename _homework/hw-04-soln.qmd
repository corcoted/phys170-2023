12 points total, 2 points each

## Problem 1
(W&W Chapter 9, Q6) What are the approximate values for the threshold of hearing and the threshold
of pain (a) in watts/meter^2^, (b) in picowatts/meter^2^, (c) in decibels?

## Problem 2
(W&W Chapter 9, P2) The intensity level of a trumpet at a distance of 10\ m is measured with a sound
level meter and found to be 78 dB. Find (a) its sound intensity in picowatts/meter^2^
and (b) the power of the source in watts.

## Problem 3
(W&W Chapter 9, P6)  If five violins sound the same note of 1000\ Hz, each at the same sound pressure
level of 60\ dB, what is their total intensity in decibels, compared with one violin
alone?

## Problem 4
Define the following measurement units and describe what they measure: (a) decibels, (b) phons, (c) sones.

## Problem 5
A trombone plays a tone at 100\ Hz with a sound pressure level (S~PL~) of 68\ dB. (a) What is the sound loudness level (S~LL~) in phons? (b) What is the sound subjective loudness (S~SL~) in sones?  (c) What musical dynamic marking does this correspond to? (Use the Fletcherâ€“Munson loudness curves from the textbook, Fig. 10-1.  The Lecture 9 class notes will also be helpful.)

## Problem 6
A guitar string has the following properties: length $L = 0.65\,\mathrm{m}$, mass per length $m = 0.0021\,\mathrm{kg/m}$, and is held with a tension force $F = 133\,\mathrm{N}$.  What is the frequency of the fundamental of this string?  Bonus: What is the nearest musical pitch? To put this string in tune, do we need to tighten it or loosen it?
