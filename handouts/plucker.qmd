This is a simplified calculation showing which harmonics are excited when a string is plucked at various locations along its length.  Use the slider to choose where along the string it is plucked, then the calculation will show the first few harmonics and their superposition.  (TODO: play a sound.)

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true

from shiny import *
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

num_modes = 10 # number of modes to include in the calculation
# TODO make num_modes a user variable

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("x", "Position", 0, 100, 50),
    #ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
    ui.output_plot("plot"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    #@render.text
    #def txt():
    #    return f"The value of n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"
    @render.plot
    def plot():
        '''Calculate and plot the modes'''
        amplitudes = 0


app = App(app_ui, server)

```
