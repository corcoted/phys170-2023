# Part 1

# Part 2
In this part you'll experiment with a simulation of plucking a guitar or violin string to see how this effects the harmonics generated by the string.

Open the "PhET Normal Modes" simulation.
Use Google to find it or use this URL: <https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/normal-modes> .

## Setup

Follow these steps to load the simulation and learn its features:

1.  Start the simulation itself by clicking on the image.
2.  Choose "One Dimension".  (The "Two Dimension" setting models a square drumhead, but we want a string for now.)
3.  You should see an orange string with 3 blue boxes on it.  You can drag the boxes to make the string move.  Play around with this.
  -  TODO: screenshot
4.  The "Normal Modes" box on the right shows the different harmonics of the string.  "Mode" is another word for "harmonic".  The number of modes used in the simulation is set by the "Number of Masses" box above.  **Change the "Number of Masses" to 9.**  As the number of modes increases and the motion of the string will be smoother.  (We're using 9 because it is the biggest odd number.  That will make some of the experiments below easier.)
  -  TODO: 
5.  The "Normal Modes" box at the bottom shows how much amplitude is in each harmonic.  Use the amplitude sliders to change these values.  How does the motion change?
6.  Click on the pause button on the right (blue circle).  Then click on the "Zero Positions" button.  This resets the simulation.
  _  With the simulation paused you can move the string (drag the blue squares) or the amplitude sliders to change the shape of the string.  Click the "play" button to start the motion again.
  -  Notice that the two sets of settings are dependent on each other: moving the string changes the amplitude sliders and vice versa.

## Experiments and questions

1.  Click "Zero Positions" and press play (if needed).  Set the "Number of Masses" to 9.  Investigate what happens if only one amplitude slider is turned on.
  -  How would you describe the motion of the string in this case?  Are these standing waves, traveling waves, or something else?
  -  Can you identify nodes and antinodes?  Count the number of nodes and antinodes when the following harmonics are turned on (by themselves): 1, 2, 5.
2.  Press "Zero Positions".  Let's pluck the string.  Move the box on the end and watch the resulting wave.  Is this a standing wave, a traveling wave, or something else?  Let the simulation run for a few seconds, then observe the wave motion again.  How has it changed?  How would you describe the values of the ampitudes?  In other words, what is the general pattern of the amplitudes?
3.  Press "Zero Positions".  Now "pluck" the string in the center.  Describe the motion of the string.  Now, look at the mode amplitudes.  What pattern do you see here?
4.  With the last two experiments in mind, why does a guitar or violin sound different when you pluck/bow it in the center instead of near the end?
5.  "Zero positions" again.  Move the amplitude sliders to turn on several of the odd-numbered modes.  Can you make a general statement about the shape of the waves when only odd modes are present?  Repeat with only even-numbered modes.  What does the mode shape look like for even modes?

# Part 3

In this part we'll take the idea of normal modes and investigate how this changes the sound.

Open the "PhET Fourier: Making Waves" simluation.  Google it or use this URL: <https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/fourier-making-waves>.  This simulation uses sound, so check the volume on your device and/or use headphones.

1.  Click the image to start the simulation.  Pick the "Discrete" page.
2.  At the top of the page are mode amplitude sliders like we saw in the "Normal Modes" simulation.
